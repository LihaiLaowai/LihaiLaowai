- 👋 Hi, I’m @LihaiLaowai
- 👀 I’m interested in JavaScript and C++, with an eye to transitioning into data analysis and pentesting.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Javascript via general courses, and C++ using Unreal 5 guided courses.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on pretty much anything beginner friendly that will help me get my feet under me.
- 📫 You can DM here for more information.
